# Image-Recognition-Using-TensorFlow
EE4907 - Final Year Project

The primary objective of this project was to develop an image recognition application that could recognise and classify various objects and locations from around the University of Limerick campus. The application was developed using TensorFlow which is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning and involved gathering 7,000 images in order for the application to be developed.
The application was deployed on Android devices and can continuously recognise whatever it sees using input frames obtained from the deviceâ€™s back camera. This allowed for any person who might not be familiar with the University of Limerick campus to use their Android device to take a photograph of the buildings and objects around them to discover their location.
